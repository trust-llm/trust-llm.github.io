Jindong Wang's personal website. Powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> with <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">al-folio</a> theme.

Tips: I moved all the js and css files from cloud to this local folder, thus makes it faster to access the website. Therefore, you can directly use my code for your website.

If you want to use this for yourself, you can fork it or click "Use this template", and modify the following necessary files:
- `_config.yml`: necessary variable values.
- All bib files inside `_bibliography` folder. Fill them with your own publications.
- `_pages/*.md`. Modify them using your own information.
- The "highlights" section in the webpage can be configured here: https://github.com/jindongwang/jindongwang.github.io/blob/master/_includes/highlights.html
